My brain hurts. This was a lot to grasp. Sometimes I sit here thinking to myself if I'm worthy enough for this field. But then again, I'm still a beginner. I can't think of things in a negative aspect because I haven't really learned yet. It's tough doing it alone. Without help, I am here pushing my limits (or so I think). One step at a time is what I keep telling myself. Next thing you know, I have a good understanding of what's in front of me, but for now, Vanilla Javascript is spoild milk and my stomach can't handle it fully.

Just needed to rant and express how I feel.
